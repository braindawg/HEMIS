### Git commit message guidline

Types of commit messages:
 * **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, packages, npm)
 * **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: artisan commands)
 * **docs**: Documentation only changes
 * **feat**: A new feature
 * **fix**: A bug fix
 * **perf**: A code change that improves performance
 * **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
 * **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
 * **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
 What this guide effectively says is that, if your commit cannot be described sticking to this guideline, then there’s something wrong with the changes you have made i.e. you should not be committing the code without refining it, or the changes should be separated into multiple commits.
